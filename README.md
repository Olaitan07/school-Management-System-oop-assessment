Title : Student Management system 

Brief Description: I created an abstract Person class containing common attributes. Staff, Student, and Applicant inherit from it. 
Teacher and Principal extend Staff. An interface was used for teaching behavior. Polymorphism is achieved by overriding showRole().
Encapsulation is applied using private fields and getters. Each class handles one responsibility.
